# Backtrader-Alpaca Trading Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• **Automate options/equities trading:** Eliminate manual execution delays and emotional decisions through systematic strategy execution
• **Unified development workflow:** Single codebase from backtesting to live trading using backtrader framework with Alpaca integration
• **Risk-controlled execution:** Implement position limits and stop-loss functionality for consistent strategy performance

### Background Context

Individual traders face significant challenges executing complex options and equities strategies manually. Current solutions require fragmented toolsets across multiple platforms for data analysis, backtesting, and trade execution, leading to inefficiencies and increased error rates.

This platform addresses the gap by integrating backtrader's proven strategy framework with Alpaca's commission-free brokerage API, enabling seamless transition from strategy development to live execution. The focus on options trading requires sophisticated data handling for Greeks calculations and complex position management that existing solutions don't adequately address.

## Requirements

### Functional

• **FR1:** System shall integrate backtrader strategies with Alpaca API for live and paper trading execution
• **FR2:** System shall process options chains data including strike prices, expiration dates, and Greeks calculations
• **FR3:** System shall execute backtests using historical data and transition same strategy code to live trading

### Non Functional

• **NFR1:** Order execution latency must be under 100ms from signal generation to API call
• **NFR2:** System shall handle 1000+ options contracts without performance degradation
• **NFR3:** Data accuracy must maintain <0.1% discrepancy between Alpaca feeds and internal calculations

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
• **Single repository:** All components (strategies, data handlers, execution engine) in unified codebase
• **Module separation:** Clear boundaries between backtesting, live trading, and data processing components
• **Shared utilities:** Common libraries for options calculations, risk management, and logging

### Service Architecture: Monolith
• **Single Python application:** Integrated backtrader framework with Alpaca API connectivity
• **Modular design:** Plugin architecture for strategies, data feeds, and execution brokers
• **Configuration-driven:** Environment-based switching between paper/live trading modes

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration
• **Unit tests:** Core strategy logic, options calculations, and data processing functions
• **Integration tests:** End-to-end backtesting workflows and Alpaca API connectivity
• **Paper trading validation:** Automated comparison between backtest and paper trading results

## Epic List

• **Epic 1: Foundation & Alpaca Integration:** Establish project setup, Alpaca API connectivity, and basic backtrader integration with paper trading capability
• **Epic 2: Options Data Pipeline:** Implement options chain processing, Greeks calculations, and historical data management for backtesting
• **Epic 3: Strategy Execution Engine:** Create unified framework for running strategies across backtest, paper, and live trading modes

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
Review this PRD and create UI/UX specifications for the command-line interface and matplotlib visualization components.

### Architect Prompt
Use this PRD to create detailed technical architecture for the backtrader-Alpaca integration platform, focusing on the monorepo structure and modular design patterns.
