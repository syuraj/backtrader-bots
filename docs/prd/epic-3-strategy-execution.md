# Epic 3: Strategy Execution Engine

**Goal:** Create unified framework enabling seamless strategy execution across backtesting, paper trading, and live trading modes with comprehensive risk controls and performance monitoring.

## Story 3.1: Unified Strategy Framework
As a developer,
I want a single strategy class that works across backtest, paper, and live modes,
so that validated strategies can be deployed without code changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ Abstract strategy base class with mode-agnostic signal generation logic
2. ✅ Environment detection and automatic broker/data feed switching (backtest/paper/live)
3. ✅ Strategy parameter validation and serialization for consistent execution

## Story 3.2: Risk Management and Position Controls
As a trader,
I want automated risk controls including position limits and stop-losses,
so that strategies cannot exceed predefined risk parameters.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ Portfolio-level position size limits and maximum drawdown protection
2. ✅ Per-strategy stop-loss and take-profit order management
3. ✅ Real-time risk metrics calculation and alert system

## Story 3.3: Performance Monitoring and Reporting
As a trader,
I want comprehensive performance tracking with CSV exports and matplotlib visualizations,
so that I can analyze strategy effectiveness and make informed decisions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ Real-time P&L tracking with Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown calculations
2. ✅ CSV export functionality for trades, positions, and performance metrics
3. ✅ Matplotlib-based performance charts including equity curves and drawdown plots
