# Epic 1: Foundation & Alpaca Integration

**Goal:** Establish project infrastructure, Alpaca API connectivity, and basic backtrader integration enabling paper trading execution with foundational logging and error handling.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration
As a developer,
I want a properly configured Python 3.13 project with dependency management,
so that I can develop and deploy the trading platform consistently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Python 3.13 virtual environment with requirements.txt containing backtrader, alpaca-py, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
2. Project structure with separate modules for strategies/, data/, execution/, and tests/
3. Configuration management for API keys and environment switching (paper/live)

## Story 1.2: Alpaca API Integration and Authentication
As a trader,
I want secure connection to Alpaca API with proper authentication,
so that I can access market data and execute trades programmatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Alpaca API client initialization with paper trading credentials
2. Connection validation and error handling for API failures
3. Basic market data retrieval for equity symbols

## Story 1.3: Basic Backtrader-Alpaca Bridge
As a developer,
I want backtrader strategies to execute through Alpaca API,
so that backtested strategies can run in paper trading mode.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Custom backtrader broker implementation using Alpaca API
2. Order execution mapping between backtrader and Alpaca order types
3. Simple buy/sell equity strategy execution in paper trading mode
